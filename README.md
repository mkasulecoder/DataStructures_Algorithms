## Introduction to Java Collections

Java Collections Framework provides a set of classes and interfaces to efficiently manage and manipulate groups of objects. It includes interfaces like `List`, `Set`, `Map`, and their implementations such as `ArrayList`, `HashSet`, and `HashMap`. Understanding these collections is essential for building robust and efficient Java applications.

## ArrayList, LinkedList

Learn about dynamic arrays (`ArrayList`), linked lists (`LinkedList`), and synchronized lists (`Vector`). Explore their characteristics, common operations, and when to choose one over the other.

```java
// Example: Creating and using an ArrayList
ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.add("Apple");
list.add("Banana");
System.out.println("ArrayList: " + list);
```

## HashMap and HashSet

Delve into the world of key-value pairs with `HashMap` and unordered unique elements with `HashSet`. See practical examples and understand their use cases.

```java
// Example: Creating and using a HashSet
HashSet<String> set = new HashSet<>();
set.add("Apple");
set.add("Banana");
System.out.println("HashSet: " + set);
```

## TreeMap and TreeSet

Explore sorted maps (`TreeMap`) and sorted sets (`TreeSet`). Learn how to leverage ordering in your collections.

```java
// Example: Creating and using a TreeMap
TreeMap<String, Integer> map = new TreeMap<>();
map.put("Apple", 5);
map.put("Banana", 3);
System.out.println("TreeMap: " + map);
```

## Common Operations and Best Practices

Discover common operations, iteration techniques, and best practices for efficient use of Java Collections.

```java
// Example: Iterating over a List
for (String element : list) {
    System.out.println(element);
}
```
